Analyzing NYC Taxi data 

### I am still working on this data.
#### Data can be  found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data). 

Objective is to explore and find relation between various attributes of data like trip duration, time, passenger count etc. 

With proper modeling technique, we should be able to predict trip duration for given trip data. 

Currently I am exploring and preparing data by some visualizations and data preparation methods.
